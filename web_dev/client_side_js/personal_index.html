  <p class="main_p">You can expect my website to be a place where you'll have the opportunity to read, visualize, and buy into adventure. In early 2016 I realized that I, Angela Marshall, only half-live my life. I say that because I lived the majority of my life out of fear. Since realizing that, I decided to make changes. I started out small...vowing to myself that I would do at least one thing I am afraid of every week. And, well, I've done it folks! I am still doing it. Now I am here to blog about it, show you my photos and videos, and display new projects that I have taken on! I also am offering my photo and video services for hire. Visit the contact page if you're interested in working together!</p>
