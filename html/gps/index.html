<!--Release 4: Reflect What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
Semantic tags clearly define content making it easier to read the code. The nav is very useful as well as the article tag.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
from top to bottom

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned how to make a snippet which is a really nice shortcut. I will definitely make more as I see a need. 

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
Creating the snippet was a little difficult but it wont be next time I do it since I know how to do it and what it's used for now. I would have to say just understanding the uses for certain semantic tags. I can improve my understanding by learning more definitions to the terminology and studying up more.-->
