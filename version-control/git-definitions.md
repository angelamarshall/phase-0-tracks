# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version Control allows contributors to a certain program/project to stay up to date with each others' changes. It is useful so eveyone can stay on the same page and always have the most recent changes. It logs the history, making it easier for many people to work on one project.  

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is what I would call a 'layer' in Photoshop. It is a copied version of an original file that you can add your own input to while still saving the original file elsehwere. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit records changes to the repository. A good commit message will swiftly explain why you made a change and how it addresses the issue.

* What is a merge conflict?
It is when Git can't figure out the changes made to a certain file and needs the user to solve the conflict. Example: if one person deletes the file while the other person modified it OR if two people changed the same lines in the same file.
