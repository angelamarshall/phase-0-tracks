- For robots who need to use an elevator:
	- Before the elevator moves:
		- Step inside the elevator and let the door close automatically behind you
		- Face the elevator door and look to the right of the door to find the elevator buttons
		- Search the button list for the floor you would like to go to 
		- Press the button that represents your desired floor
		- Stand in the back of the elevator and face the door. Keep watching the number above the door. It will tell you which floor you are on. 
	- If the elevator stops before your desired floor:
		- Stand still in the elevator and wait till others get in or out of the elevator.
		- Wait for the doors to close and the elevator will move to your desired floor.
		- Once the number above the elevator reads your floor number, get out of the elevator.
