Create a class for the guessing game (designed for a computer program to use on a human directly)
make the guesses and progress readable but not accessible 

create a method that gives the user 2 feedback about the letters they are guessing 
	- if they guess the wrong letter let them know that they guessed incorrectly and 	tell them how many guesses they have left and what their progress is
	- if they guess the right letter let them know that they guessed correctly and 		tell them how many guesses they have left and what their progress is


create a method that responds to whether or not user 2 guessed the same word as user 1
	- give a congratulatory message if they win and a taunting message if they lose


create a method that keeps the correct letters guessed
	- add each correct letter to the progress 

create a method that determines if the game is finished
	- game is finished if user 2 guesses user 1’s word

create a method to celebrate

create a method to taunt 




Driver Code:
Welcome the user to the guessing game

Ask user 1 to enter a word 

Ask user 2 to guess a letter (keep asking to the point of the length of user 1’s word)

Celebrate user 2 if they get the word right, taunt them if not.



























create a class for the guessing game

	first user inputs a word
	steps: initialize the word and set certain parameters needed
	outcome: sets guesses to the word’s length and ensures that all letters are 		downcase

	method to capture, measure and respond to the second users guesses 
	steps: 
	*ensure the length of guesses does not exceed the word length
	*celebrate when full word is guessed correctly, taunt when full word is guessed 	incorrectly
	*a statement to respond positively if the user guesses a correct letter, and 		negatively if not. 
	outcome: second user input will be responded to with a string stating the outcome 	of their plays
	
	method to keep a correct guessed letter
	steps: take the second users answer go through the first users word to see if it 	matches any to keep 
	outcome: will keep the correct letter guessed

	method to define when the second user has finished the game 
	steps: if the progress is equal to the answer the game is finished
	outcome: will link to another method in order to celebrate or not

	method to celebrate
	steps: write and encouraging string to the user
	outcome: if the second user won the game they will receive the string
